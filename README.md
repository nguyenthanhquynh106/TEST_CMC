### 1. Intersection
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection

### 2. Two Sum
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they
add up to a specific target number.
The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target,
where index1 must be less than index2.

### 3. Maximum Subarray
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one
number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

### 4. Climbing Stair
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### 5. Merge Intervals
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all
overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover
all the intervals in the input.

### 6. Container With Most Water
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at
coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the
line i is at (i, ai)and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a
container, such that the container contains the most water.
Notice that you may not slant the container.

### 7. 3Sum
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all
unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
